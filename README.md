# CS210-CPlusPlus
Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The project was used to create a tracking system for the animals in the zoo and link java with C++. The user will be able to add and remove animals and create a file and save data nd load data to display information professionally to the user. 

What did you do particularly well?
I was able to create the classes and their header files and create an output that was displayed to the user. This will help the application maintain itself and separate the different types of animals in the zoo. The user will be able to add animals that the user has and take out animals. The user can also get a file to show the information. 

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I could enhance the code by learning more about using the matrices and use if statements to stop the user from entering wrong data. 

Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
I found out that writing some of the functions were challenging. I used the zybooks to help me understand the concepts that were being used. I would add the virtual machines and the coding in Eclipse to the resources. 

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
The use of the files and the classes will be transferable to other projects. They will help make more professional results for the user and make it user friendly. 

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I used if statements and files and user inputs to help maintain the code and help the user understand what is needed. I also included comments to remember what a piece of the code does.
